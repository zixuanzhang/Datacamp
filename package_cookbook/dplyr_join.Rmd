* primary key: the variables that uniquely define each row; sometimes we need a combination of variables as the **key** to define each row.

* secondary key: the variable that matches the primary key

#### leftjoin 
`left_join(x,y)`: join y to x

example:  

# Complete the code to join artists to bands: use a combination of first and last name

bands2 <- left_join(bands,artists, by = c("first","last")) 

#### right join:

band3 <- right_join(artists, bands, by = c("first", "last"))

# Check that bands3 is equal to bands2
setequal(bands2, bands3)

#### inner_join() and full_join()

You can think of `inner_join` as the **most strict type** of join: they only retain observations that appear in **both** datasets.   
In contrast, `full_join` are the most permissive type of join: they return all of the data that appears in both datasets (often resulting in many missing values). Full_join will help construct an intact database

# Join albums to songs using inner_join()
`inner_join(songs, albums, by = "album")` : album is the common variable

# Join bands to artists using full_join()
`full_join(artists, bands, by = c("first", "last"))`: first and last names are the common variables

#### use pipe to achieve this

bands %>% 
     left_join(artists, by = c("first","last")) %>% 
     filter(instrument == "Guitar") %>% 
     select(first, last, band)

#### semi_join()

As you saw in the video, semi-joins provide a concise way to filter data from the first dataset based on information in a second dataset.

`artists %>% semi_join(songs, by = c("first", "last"))`

#### anti_join: 

you can use an anti-join to see which rows will not be matched to a second dataset by a join.
   
# Check whether album names in labels are mis-entered

`labels %>% anti_join(albums, by = "album")`: check if the labels are misentered like misspelling

#### set(): used when the variables names are the same for two dataframes.

1. count the total number use `union()`:  

`aerosmith %>% union(greatest_hits) %>% nrow()`

remark: union will remove duplicated rows

2. The hits occur in both dataset: use `intersect()`

`aerosmith %>% intersect(greatest_hits)`

3. Find elements in one dataset but not in the others:

`setdiff(x,y)`: select the dataset in x but not in y

example:  

Select the song names from live:

`live_songs <- live %>% select(song)`

Select the song names from greatest_hits

`greatest_songs <- greatest_hits %>% select(song)`

Create the new dataset using a set operation

`live_songs %>% setdiff(greatest_songs)`
     
practice: select songs that unique to each data frame:  

# Select songs from live and greatest_hits
live_songs <- live %>% select(song)
greatest_songs <- greatest_hits %>% select(song)


# Return the songs that only exist in one dataset
a <- setdiff(live_songs, greatest_songs)
b <- setdiff(greatest_songs, live_songs)
union(a,b)

# Return songs in definitive that are not in complete  

`definitive %>% anti_join(complete)`

# Return songs in complete that are not in definitive  

`complete %>% anti_join(definitive)`  

# check if two datasets are the same:  

* `identical(df1, df2)` will return true only if two datasets have the same contents and in the same order;
* `setequal(df1, df2)` will return true if they have the same content. this method is usually prefered.

---------------

#### bind
`bind_rows(df1, df2)`: bind df1 and df2 into a single dataset

#### Examine discography and jimi
discography
jimi

`jimi %>% bind_rows(.id = "album") %>% left_join(discography)`

#### make data frame

Make combined data frame using data_frame()  

`data_frame(year = hank_year, song = hank_song, peak = hank_peak) %>% filter(peak == 1)`

#### Convert the hank list into a data frame
`as_data_frame(hank) %>% filter(peak == 1)` hank is a list of data frameï¼Œcannot bind a list of vector(eg. names of a data frame)

instead we can use `bind_rows`:
